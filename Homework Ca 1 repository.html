                <h1>Gmail</h1>
                <p id="1"><strong>Gmail</strong> is a free <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email">email</a>
                    service
                    provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a>. As of 2019, it had 1.5
                    billion
                    active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)">users</a> worldwide.<sup>[1]</sup> A
                    user typically accesses Gmail in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web
                        browser</a>
                    or the official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app">mobile app</a>. Google also
                    supports
                    the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_client">email clients</a> via the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol">POP</a> and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">IMAP</a> protocols.
                    At its launch in 2004, Gmail provided a storage capacity of one <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte">gigabyte</a> per user, which was significantly
                    higher
                    than its competitors offered at the time. Today, the service comes with 15 gigabytes of storage.
                    Users
                    can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, while they can send emails up
                    to
                    25 megabytes. In order to send larger files, users can insert files from <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Drive">Google Drive</a> into the message. Gmail has a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine">search</a>-oriented interface and a <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail_interface#Conversation_view">"conversation view"</a>
                    similar to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum">Internet forum</a>. The service
                    is
                    notable among website developers for its early adoption of <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">Ajax</a>.
                    Google's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to filter <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming">spam</a> and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">malware</a>, and to add context-sensitive
                    advertisements next to emails. This advertising practice has been significantly criticized by
                    privacy
                    advocates due to concerns over unlimited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_retention">data
                        retention</a>, ease of monitoring by third parties, users of other email providers not having
                    agreed
                    to the policy upon sending emails to Gmail addresses, and the potential for Google to change its
                    policies to further decrease privacy by combining information with other Google data usage. The
                    company
                    has been the subject of lawsuits concerning the issues. Google has stated that email users must
                    "necessarily expect" their emails to be subject to automated processing and claims that the service
                    refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages, such as those mentioning race,
                    religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements. In June 2017, Google announced the
                    end to
                    the use of contextual Gmail content for advertising purposes, relying instead on data gathered from
                    the
                    use of its other services.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

                <h1>Storage</h1>
                <p id="2"> 1. On April 1, 2004, Gmail was launched with one <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte">gigabyte</a> (GB) of storage space, a
                    significantly
                    higher amount than competitors offered at the time.<sup>[4]</sup>
                    2. On April 1, 2005, the first anniversary of Gmail, the limit was doubled to two gigabytes of
                    storage.
                    Georges Harik, the product management director for Gmail, stated that Google would "keep giving
                    people
                    more space forever."<sup>[5]</sup>
                    3. On April 24, 2012, Google announced the increase of storage included in Gmail from 7.5 to 10
                    gigabytes ("and counting") as part of the launch of <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Drive">Google Drive</a>.<sup>[6]</sup>
                    4. On May 13, 2013, Google announced the overall merge of storage across Gmail, Google Drive, and
                    Google+ Photos, allowing users 15 gigabytes of included storage among three
                    services.<sup>[7][8]</sup>
                    5. On August 15, 2018, Google launched Google One, a service where users can pay for additional
                    storage,
                    shared among Gmail, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Drive">Google Drive</a> and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos">Google Photos</a>, through a monthly
                    subscription
                    plan. As of 2021, storage of up to 15 gigabytes is included, and paid plans are available for up to
                    2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte">terabytes</a> for personal use.<sup>[9]</sup></p>

                <h1>Interface</h1>
                <p id="3">The Gmail <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">user interface</a> initially
                    differed from other web-mail systems with its focus on <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine">search</a> and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_threading">conversation threading</a> of
                    emails,
                    grouping several messages between two or more people onto a single page, an approach that was later
                    copied by its competitors. Gmail's user interface designer, <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Fox_(designer)">Kevin Fox</a>, intended users to feel
                    as
                    if they were always on one page and just changing things on that page, rather than having to
                    navigate to
                    other places.<sup>[14]</sup>

                    Gmail's interface also makes use of 'labels' (tags) - that replace the conventional folders and
                    provide
                    a more flexible method of organizing emails; filters for automatically organizing, deleting or
                    forwarding incoming emails to other addresses; and importance markers for automatically marking
                    messages
                    as 'important'.

                    In November 2011, Google began rolling out a redesign of its interface that "simplified" the look of
                    Gmail into a more minimalist design to provide a more consistent look throughout its products and
                    services as part of an overall Google design change. Majorly redesigned elements included a
                    streamlined
                    conversation view, configurable density of information, new higher-quality themes, a resizable
                    navigation bar with always-visible labels and contacts, and better search.<sup>[15][16]</sup>Users
                    were
                    able to preview the new interface design for months prior to the official release, as well as revert
                    to
                    the old interface, until March 2012, when Google discontinued the ability to revert and completed
                    the
                    transition to the new design for all users.<sup>[17]</sup>

                    In May 2013, Google updated the Gmail inbox with tabs which allow the application to categorize the
                    user's emails. The five tabs are: Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, and Forums. In addition to
                    customization options, the entire update can be disabled, allowing users to return to the
                    traditional
                    inbox structure.<sup>[18][19]</sup>

                    In April 2018, Google introduced a new web UI for Gmail. The new redesign follows Google's <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design">Material Design</a>, and changes in the
                    user
                    interface include the use of Google's Product Sans font. Other updates include a Confidential mode,
                    which allows the sender to set an expiration date for a sensitive message or to revoke it entirely,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_rights_management">integrated rights
                        management</a>
                    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">two-factor
                        authentication</a>.<sup>[20]</sup>

                    On 16 November 2020, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> announced new
                    settings
                    for smart features and personalization in Gmail. Under the new settings users were given control of
                    their data in Gmail, Chat, and Meet, offering smart features like Smart Compose and Smart
                    Reply.<sup>[21]</sup>

                    On 6 April 2021, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> rolled out Google Chat
                    and
                    Room (early access) feature to all Gmail users.<sup>[22][23]</sup></p>

                <h1>Spam</h1>
                <p1 id="4">Gmail's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering">spam filtering</a> features a
                    community-driven system: when any user marks an email as <a
                        herf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spam">spam</a>, this provides information to help the
                    system identify similar future messages for all Gmail users.<sup>[24]</sup>

                    In the April 2018 update, the spam filtering banners got a redesign, with bigger and bolder
                    lettering.
                </p1>

                <h1>Gmail Labs</h1>
                <p1 id="5">The Gmail Labs feature, introduced on June 5, 2008, allows users to test new or experimental
                    features of Gmail. Users can enable or disable Labs features selectively and provide feedback about
                    each
                    of them. This allows Gmail engineers to obtain user input about new features to improve them and
                    also to
                    assess their popularity.<sup>[25]</sup>

                    Popular features, like the "Undo Send" option, often "graduate" from Gmail Labs to become a formal
                    setting in Gmail.<sup>[26]</sup>

                    All Labs features are experimental and are subject to termination at any time.<sup>[27]</sup></p1>

                <h1>Search</h1>
                <p1 id="6"><strong>Gmail</strong> incorporates a search bar for searching emails. The search bar can
                    also
                    search contacts, files stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Drive">Google
                        Drive</a>,
                    events from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Calendar">Google Calendar</a>, and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Sites">Google Sites</a>.<sup>[28][29][30]</sup>

                    In May 2012, Gmail improved the search functionality to include auto-complete predictions from the
                    user's emails.<sup>[31]</sup>
                    Gmail's search functionality does not support searching for word fragments (also known as 'substring
                    search' or partial word search). Workarounds exist.<sup>[31]</sup></p1>

                <h1>Lnaguage Support</h1>
                <p1 id="7">As of March 2015, the Gmail interface supports 72 languages, including: <a
